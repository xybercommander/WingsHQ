<h2 align="center" id="Inspiration"> :label: Inspiration</h2>

With more and more doctors and frontline workers joining the force for saving people's lives due to covid 19, thus creating a shortage in doctor appointments for people who are suffering from various diseases. It's high time to bridge the gap between the two. WingsHQ solves this problem by leveraging the power of community.
The idea was generated during the HackMIT Hackathon by MIT. 

WingsHQ is a mobile Application made using Flutter to create a community driven health platform for various day-to-day health related issues. A User can make an account on WingsHQ and join exclusive groups which he/she wants to join to talk about the problems they are facing in their health. A dedicated professional help and assistance page is made to take professional advice from doctors who are available and can help people from anywhere in the world by chatting with them.

  #### Main Features
  
   :point_right: Community Groups - Anyone can share their problems, their stories, take help from the community and live a healthy life. The group chat features allows multiple users to join multiple groups at the same time. Every time a new group is made, the person who made the group becomes Admin. The most important thing to preserve a person's privacy is a proper way of communication. So We have introduced an [end-to-end encrypted chat system (AES)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38849650/108539385-f0fbda00-7305-11eb-9680-5300a842dfb9.png) which takes care if all messages are encrypted.
   <br>
   
   :point_right: Healthcare Professional Page- A separate page has been introduced which shows a user the list of professional doctors and surgeons who are available and can help them with professional advice. <br/>
    <ul>:point_right:  Timeline Page- The Home Page/Timeline Page of the app is divided into two sections
       <li> New Groups- This container fetches all the newly formed groups and adds that to the listview using horizontal scroll<br/>
       <li> Health News- The Health News Section cooperates with gnews.io (public api) api to fetch and gather all the health related news and shows that to the user. A "see more" feature is also added to <br/>
  
   </ul>
     
  #### Additional Features
  
   
   :point_right: Extensive Search: With the search feature, a user can find a group which they want to join in. Based on groups the results will be shown and they can join the group in just one click. <br/>
   :point_right: BMI Calculator: Based on the height and weight of the user, the BMI calculator feature calculates the BMI of a person. This helps him to know that if he is underweight or overweight or normal. <br/>

<h2 align="center" id="Stepstofollow"> ‚≠ê Steps to follow :scroll:</h2>

<br>


### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install The Apk into your Android Phone

You can download the apk from google drive and install the app by clicking <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lHiOwz95WwrkV7GB7cfqZtZQa7tYYsU1/view?usp=sharing">here</a>

<br>


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone it :busts_in_silhouette:

You need to clone (download) it to local machine using

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Your_Username/WingsHQ.git
```

> This makes a local copy of repository in your machine.

Once you have cloned the `WingsHQ` repository in Github, move to that folder first using change directory command on linux and Mac.

```sh
# This will change directory to a folder  WingsHQ
$ cd WingsHQ
```

Move to this folder for all other commands.

<br>



### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set it up :arrow_up:

Run the following commands to see that *your local copy* has a reference to *your forked remote repository* in Github :octocat:

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/WingsHQ.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/WingsHQ.git (push)
```
Now, lets add a reference to the original [WingsHQ](https://github.com/xybercommander/WingsHQ) repository using

```sh
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/xybercommander/WingsHQ.git
```

> This adds a new remote named ***upstream***.

See the changes using

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/WingsHQ.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/WingsHQ.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/xybercommander/WingsHQ.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/xybercommander/WingsHQ.git (push)
```

<br>



### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Sync it :recycle:

Always keep your local copy of repository updated with the original repository.
Before making any changes and/or in an appropriate interval, run the following commands *carefully* to update your local repository.

```sh
# Fetch all remote repositories and delete any deleted remote branches
$ git fetch --all --prune

# Switch to `master` branch
$ git checkout master

# Reset local `master` branch to match `upstream` repository's `master` branch
$ git reset --hard upstream/master

# Push changes to your forked `WingsHQ  ` repo
$ git push origin master
```

<br>



### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Ready Steady Go... :turtle: :rabbit2:

Once you have completed these steps, you are ready to start contributing by checking our `Help Wanted` Issues and creating

<br>

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Create a new branch :bangbang:

Whenever you are going to make contribution. Please create separate branch using command and keep your `master` branch clean (i.e. synced with remote branch).

```sh
# It will create a new branch with name Branch_Name and switch to branch Folder_Name
$ git checkout -b Folder_Name
```

Create a separate branch for contribution and try to use same name of branch as of folder.

To switch to desired branch

```sh
# To switch from one folder to other
$ git checkout Folder_Name
```

To add the changes to the branch. Use

```sh
# To add all files to branch Folder_Name
$ git add .
```

Type in a message relevant for the code reviewer using

```sh
# This message get associated with all files you have changed
$ git commit -m 'relevant message'
```

<br>


### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Share your work :star_struck:

Now, Push your awesome work to your remote repository using

```sh
# To push your work to your remote repository
$ git push -u origin Folder_Name
```

Then, go to your repository in browser and click on `compare and pull requests`.
Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your precious effort.
